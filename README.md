# WordChanger
Chrome extension that allows users to simply adjust text on their favorite websites. Hilarious on news articles, shopping websites, and social media posts.

Once a page is loaded in your browser, open up WordChanger from your extensions bar. 

The extension has two input fields, "Change This" and "To This." Simply enter the word/text you want to change in the first input field, and then whatever word you want to change it to in the second field. Then press the "Chaos" button.

WordChanger has the ability to make as many word changes as you'd like on a single website, so the fun doesn't stop with the first swap.

Note: to remove the swaps, simply refresh the page.
